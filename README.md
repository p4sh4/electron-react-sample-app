# electron-react-sample-app

Sample app to demostrate integration of Electron and React that shows data fetched from a remote server.

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Start the back-end server:
```    
node server.js
```
2. Start the Electron app:
```
npm start
```

## Notes

You can pass a `--varsize` option to the `node server.js` command to generate a different number of orders each time, to make it look a bit more like a real-world order screen.
